# ListyString
Linked List Manipulation

This program was created in order to be able to learn to manipulate Linked Lists. Linked Lists are better than arrays in the fact that they can easily be manipulated. Arrays are used with a specific length, but linked lists are not restrained by this. You are able to create and destroy memory where necessary. 

In this program, we are creating and destroying memory based off of the words that are being thrown in. On top of that, when you get a specific special character (i.e. "!", "+", "-", etc.) you do a specific task based off of the operation. Linked Lists save up a lot of memory compared to arrays and they are maliable.
